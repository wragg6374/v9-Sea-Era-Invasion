3. **Extract the Files** 📂  
   Once downloaded, locate the ZIP file in your Downloads folder. Right-click it and select "Extract All." Choose a safe directory, like C:\Games\AgeOfWaterHack, to keep things organized. Use emojis to label your folders if you want—e.g., name one "🌊Mods" for fun! Windows 2025 has improved file extraction speeds, so this should take seconds. 🚀🗂️

4. **Run the Installer** ⚙️  
   Inside the extracted folder, double-click the installer executable (e.g., AoWHackInstaller.exe). This script is custom-built for 2025 Windows environments, so it will automatically detect your game version and apply the necessary hacks. If prompted, grant administrator permissions by clicking "Yes" on the UAC dialog. Watch for the progress bar—it's super satisfying! 😊🔧

5. **Configure and Launch** 🎯  
   After installation, open the configuration tool (Config.exe) to tweak settings. For example, enable infinite resources by toggling the switch—represented by a shiny 💎 emoji in the interface. Once set, launch Age of Water from your Steam or standalone library. The hack integrates seamlessly, adding features like faster build times and enhanced AI.

6. **Troubleshooting Common Issues** ⚠️  
   Even with 2025's advanced Windows features, things can go wrong. If the hack doesn't load, ensure your antivirus isn't interfering—temporarily disable it during installation. Error codes? Check the log file in your install directory for details, like "Error 2025-01" which might mean a missing DLL. Re-download if needed, and always back up your game files first. We've included a quick-fix script for Windows-specific errors, labeled with a 🔨 emoji for easy spotting. 💻🛠️
